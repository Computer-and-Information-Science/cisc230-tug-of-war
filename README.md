# CISC230 - Tug-Of-War

This repositories contains two copies of the Tug-Of-War program that was
presented in class.

Devise two greedy algorithms for solving the Tug-Of-War problem, one online
algorithm and one offline algorithm. Implement each in its own source file:
*tug-of-war_online.cpp* and *tug-of-war_offline.cpp*.

Both of your algorithms should be an attempt at gaining a near optimal 
solution to the problem. For an optimal solution, the number of participants
on each team will differ by no more than one, and the different in total
weight between the two team would be as small as possible.

The starter code given is an online approach that simply alternates
participants between teams, but makes no attempt to achieve a near optimal
solution. An offline approach was presented in class that pre-sorts the
participant list then alternates participants between teams.

Your solutions should make some attempt to be better than the two mentioned
above. The actual algorithms are up to you.

## Algorithms and Code Reflection

In addition to coding your algorithms, describe your approach for each
of the two algorithms in a paragraph or two.

After completing your code, write a short discussion on your experience
implementing these algorithms. Discuss any difficulties you encountered
and how you overcame those difficulties if any, or any particular successes
you had.
Also, discuss how you tested your code.

Provide your descriptions in file *RESPONSES.md*.
